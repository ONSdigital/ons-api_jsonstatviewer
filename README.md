JSON-Stat Viewer
======================

 
This is a simple web page that allows you to browse and tabulate JSON-Stat output from the ONS API. 
 
It can be run by supplying a URL an pressing the Upper Go button. This will populate the textarea and create the visual representation of the structure below.
 
You can toggle between the structure and a Google Visualiser table using the Show Data button. If you paste JSON-Stat code into the textarea (or modify the code in the textarea) you will need to press the lower Go button to apply this.
